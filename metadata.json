    "Description": "IDL-PPBopt aims at identifying the chemical substructures in small molecules that drive plasma protein binding (PPB). Using a curated PPB dataset, the authors identify the substructures that drive ppb in the molecules, identifying a total of 22 privileged substructures (GPSubs). In a second step, they identify second chemical rules for each GPSub and obtain substructure pairs that can be used to optimize PPB during drug design.",
